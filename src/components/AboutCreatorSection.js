        Hi, I'm Nick Sharma, a student who took AP Calculus AB and knows how overwhelming it can feel when concepts aren't explained clearly. I created OpenCalc to fix that — to give every student access to a free, visual, and down-to-earth way to actually understand calculus. Whether you're just starting or reviewing for the exam, I hope this platform helps make things click.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not a big education company — just someone who figured, if I struggled, others probably do too. That's why OpenCalc will always be 100% free.

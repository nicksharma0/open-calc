## Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes

When a function grows without bound near a point, the limit is **infinite**, and the graph often shows a **vertical asymptote**.

---

## Notation

If $f(x)$ increases without bound as $x \to a$:

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty
$$

Or:

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to a^-} f(x) = -\infty
$$

---

## Example

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 3}
$$

As $x \to 3^-$, $f(x) \to -\infty$  
As $x \to 3^+$, $f(x) \to \infty$

So there is a **vertical asymptote** at $x = 3$.

## What’s Next

We’ll now explore limits as $x$ approaches **infinity**, and how that relates to **horizontal asymptotes**.

## What Is the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)?

If a function is **continuous** on $[a, b]$, then it must take **every value** between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.

---

## IVT Statement

If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $N$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$,  
then there exists **at least one** $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that:

$$
f(c) = N
$$

---

## Example

Let $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$  
We know:

- $f(1) = -1$
- $f(2) = 5$

Since 0 is between $-1$ and $5$, there must be **some $c$ in $(1, 2)$** such that:

$$
f(c) = 0
$$

This proves a solution **exists**, even if we don’t know its exact value.

## When to Use It

- Showing a solution exists  
- Explaining root-finding algorithms  
- Connecting continuity with **real-world guarantees**

## Final Thoughts

With this, you’ve completed the core ideas of **limits and continuity**—the essential building blocks of calculus.

## Continuity Over Intervals

A function is **continuous on an interval** if it's continuous **at every point** in the interval.

---

## Types of Intervals

- **Open interval** $(a, b)$ → Function must be continuous at all points **between** $a$ and $b$.
- **Closed interval** $[a, b]$ → Must be continuous at all interior points, and:
  - **Right-continuous** at $a$
  - **Left-continuous** at $b$

## Example

If $f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1$, it’s continuous **everywhere**, so it’s continuous on any interval.

---

## Key Takeaway

Continuity over an interval requires **no breaks** across the entire span—this is essential for many theorems in calculus.

## What’s Next

Sometimes we can fix discontinuities—let’s look at how to **remove** them.

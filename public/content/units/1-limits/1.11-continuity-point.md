## What Does It Mean to Be Continuous?

A function is **continuous at a point** if there are **no breaks, holes, or jumps** at that point.

---

## Formal Definition

A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = a$ if:

1. $f(a)$ is defined  
2. $\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists  
3. $\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$

All three conditions must be true.

---

## Example

Let:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 & x \ne 2 \\\\ 5 & x = 2 \end{cases}
$$

- $f(2) = 5$
- $\lim\limits_{x \to 2} f(x) = 4$

Since the limit does not equal the function value, $f(x)$ is **not continuous** at $x = 2$.

## What’s Next

Let’s extend this idea to full **intervals**, not just points.

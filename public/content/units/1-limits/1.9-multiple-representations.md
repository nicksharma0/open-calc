## One Concept, Many Views

Limits can be understood from:
- A **graph** (what the curve approaches)
- A **table** (numerical estimates)
- An **expression** (algebraic manipulation)

Mastery means being able to **move between these views**.

## Visual → Numerical

From a graph, you might estimate:

$$
\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) \approx 5
$$

Use a table to confirm:

| $x$      | $f(x)$       |
|----------|--------------|
| 2.9      | 4.9          |
| 2.99     | 4.99         |
| 3.01     | 5.01         |
| 3.1      | 5.1          |

## Analytical → Visual

From a formula:

$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}
$$

Algebra: $\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) = 6$  
Draw a graph to confirm: as $x \to 3$, the curve approaches $y = 6$

## Key Takeaway

Each form gives unique insight. The best learners can:

- Estimate from a **graph**
- Verify with a **table**
- Confirm with **algebra**

## What’s Next

We now turn to **discontinuities**—situations where limits help explain breaks or gaps in functions.

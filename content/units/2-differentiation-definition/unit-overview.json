    "Derivatives tell us how fast something is changing at an exact moment—like speed at an instant.",
    "Rules and limits help us simplify how we find those rates of change across different functions.",
    "If a derivative is positive, the original function is increasing—helpful in understanding trends.",
    "You can use derivatives to model real-world problems, like education spending or motion.",
    "Recognizing patterns and applying the right rule makes complex differentiation easier.",
    "Derivatives can become functions too—this helps us understand both the function and its behavior."

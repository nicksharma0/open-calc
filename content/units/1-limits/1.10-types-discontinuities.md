## What Is a Discontinuity?

A discontinuity occurs when a function is **not continuous** at a point. This means there's some kind of "break" in the graph.

---

## Types of Discontinuities

1. **Removable Discontinuity**  
   - The limit exists, but the function is either undefined or has a different value.
   - Often caused by a hole in the graph.

2. **Jump Discontinuity**  
   - The left-hand and right-hand limits exist but are **not equal**.
   - Often seen in piecewise functions.

3. **Infinite Discontinuity**  
   - The function increases or decreases without bound near a point.
   - Occurs at vertical asymptotes.

## Example Graphs to Include

- Hole at $x = 2$
- Step/jump at $x = 1$
- Asymptote at $x = -3$

## Key Takeaway

Discontinuities reveal where a function **fails to behave nicely**.  
Understanding them is key for calculus and real-world modeling.

## What’s Next

Next, we’ll define **continuity at a point** using a formal, mathematical approach.

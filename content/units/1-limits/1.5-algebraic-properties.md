## Why Use Limit Properties?

Sometimes you don’t need a graph or table—you can evaluate limits using known **rules and identities**.

These algebraic limit laws let you break complex expressions into manageable parts.

## Key Limit Properties

Let $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = M$:

- **Sum Rule:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a} [f(x) + g(x)] = L + M
  $$

- **Difference Rule:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a} [f(x) - g(x)] = L - M
  $$

- **Constant Multiple Rule:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a} [c \cdot f(x)] = c \cdot L
  $$

- **Product Rule:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = L \cdot M
  $$

- **Quotient Rule:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L}{M}, \quad \text{if } M \ne 0
  $$

## Example

Evaluate:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} (3x^2 + 5x - 4)
$$

Since this is a polynomial (continuous everywhere), just plug in:

$$
3(2)^2 + 5(2) - 4 = 12 + 10 - 4 = \boxed{18}
$$

## When to Use This

✅ Use when:
- Functions are continuous
- You’re combining simpler limits
- You want exact values quickly

## What’s Next

Next, we’ll use **algebraic manipulation** to simplify more complex limits, including those with indeterminate forms.

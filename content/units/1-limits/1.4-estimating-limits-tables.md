## How Can a Table Help Estimate a Limit?

Even without a graph, we can estimate a limit by looking at a **table of values**.

If the $x$-values get close to a number (say, 2), and the $f(x)$ values seem to approach a single value, that’s likely the **limit**.

This method is useful when:
- The function is too complex to graph
- We want a numerical estimate
- The function isn’t defined at the point

## Example 1: Estimating from Both Sides

| $x$     | $f(x)$     |
|--------:|-----------:|
| 1.9     | 3.98       |
| 1.99    | 3.998      |
| 1.999   | 3.9998     |
| 2.001   | 4.0002     |
| 2.01    | 4.002      |
| 2.1     | 4.02       |

As $x \to 2$, $f(x)$ approaches 4 from **both sides**. So:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 4
$$

## One-Sided Estimations

You can also estimate **left** and **right** limits separately:

- From the **left**: $x = 1.9, 1.99, 1.999$ → $f(x) \to 4$
- From the **right**: $x = 2.001, 2.01, 2.1$ → $f(x) \to 4$

Because both sides approach the same value, the **two-sided limit exists** and equals 4.

## Example 2: When the Limit Does Not Exist

| $x$     | $f(x)$     |
|---------|------------|
| 0.99    | 1.5        |
| 0.999   | 1.9        |
| 1.001   | 5.2        |
| 1.01    | 7.6        |

- As $x \to 1^-$, $f(x) \to 2$
- As $x \to 1^+$, $f(x) \to 6$

Since the left and right sides approach **different values**, the limit **does not exist**:

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) \text{ does not exist}
$$

## Key Takeaways

- Tables can **numerically estimate** limits.
- Always check values approaching from **both sides**.
- If both sides approach the same number, that’s the **limit**.
- If they diverge, the limit **does not exist**.

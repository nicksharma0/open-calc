## Can You Fix a Discontinuity?

Yes! A **removable discontinuity** can often be fixed by redefining the function at a single point.

---

## Example

Let:

$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
f(x) = x + 1, \quad x \ne 1
$$

The function has a **hole** at $x = 1$, but we can define:

$$
f(1) = 2
$$

Now the function is continuous at $x = 1$.

## Strategy

1. Simplify expression  
2. Identify point of discontinuity  
3. Redefine $f(x)$ at that point to match the limit

Now we’ll explore **infinite limits** and what they tell us about **vertical asymptotes**.

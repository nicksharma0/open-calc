## How Do I Know Which Method to Use?

Limits can be evaluated using:
- Substitution
- Graphs
- Tables
- Algebra
- Theorems

Choosing the best tool saves time and avoids mistakes.

## Decision Chart

1. **Try Direct Substitution**  
   - If it works, you're done!
2. **Indeterminate Form?**
   - Try algebraic simplification (factoring, rationalizing)
3. **Still stuck?**
   - Try graphical or numerical estimation
4. **Approaching 0 or infinity in a trig/exponential?**
   - Consider the **Squeeze Theorem** or special limits

## Example

Evaluate:

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}
$$

Step 1: Plug in → $\frac{0}{0}$ → Indeterminate  
Step 2: Factor numerator → $\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1}$  
Step 3: Cancel and evaluate → $\boxed{2}$

## What’s Next

Sometimes algebra isn't enough.  
Next, we’ll apply the **Squeeze Theorem**, especially useful for trig functions.
